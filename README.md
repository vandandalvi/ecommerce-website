I created a web app to help my mom manage her product sales more efficiently, which she previously handled via WhatsApp. In this app, she acts as the admin and can add products with images, descriptions, prices, and sub-images. Customers can sign up, log in, view products, and place orders by filling out basic details such as address, pincode, etc. The admin can view customer order details and proceed with product delivery.

The project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, MongoDB for the backend, and is hosted on Render. Server-side logic is handled in server.js, environment variables are managed using a .env file, and dependencies are listed in package.json.
